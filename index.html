        <p class="description">What are the most commonly used phrases that Americans use when starting their sentences? 
            This website aims to identify five common sentence-starters that we use informally in our daily lives, 
            examining our comprehension skills and limited vocabulary usage.
            Click each square to see the real-life scenarios of a conversation. Then, drag each square to the nearest sentence starter that you would most likely use to respond to the situation.</p>
